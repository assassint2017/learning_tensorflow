# learning_tensorflow
Some code I write when I'm learning tensorflow

First is the LeNet on MNIST dataset

Second is the VGGNet13-GAP on CIFAR10 dataset, I use pytorch/torchvision to get the `.png` format images and organize them in `train` and `test` file folders, in each one of them, there are ten subfloder named `0` to `9` to store one class of the dataset images, here is how I arange my image data

Third is the VGGNet19-GAP stil on the CIFAR10 dataset using multi gpu
